# there are so many files here that I don't want to keep, but gitignore does 
# not do regular expressions, so start off by telling it to ignore everything
#  Note: Due to the lack of regular expressions, it is easier to tell 
#  gitignore to not ignore a select few items than to tell it to ignore 
#  everything else.
#  This creates an issue with subfolders, because they cannot be un-ignored 
#  selectively with something like "!my_subfolder/**", as the documentation at
#  the provided link at the top of this file suggests when talking about the 
#  trailing "/**".  When everything is ignored, selective folder un-ignoring 
#  apparently not kosher, even with something like "!my_subfolder/*.cpp".
#  To get around this, I use working syntax to not ignore certain file types,
#  and then tell gitignore to not ignore any subfolders.
#  This effectively un-does everything that "*" does, except that it results 
#  in less typing for me.

# now tell gitignore to not ignore gitignore and gitattributes because these 
# are git special repository files that do magic, so I should keep them around
!.gitignore
!.gitattributes

# don't ignore my project files, which are in C++ and text files that I have 
# appended with the suffix "glsl", or "GL Scripting Language"
!*.h
!*.cpp
!*.glsl

# now un-ignore all subfolders
